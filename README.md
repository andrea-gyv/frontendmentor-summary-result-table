## My process

my 4th standalone frontend mentor challenge. I have choen this one to try my best with the very little knowledge of html and css that i have and then check the solution of kevin powell ( youtibe video)
these files contain my own version that is not 100% precise but i am happy with the result as I take this as a practice

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow / desltop-first html

### What I learned

to use gradient colors in css as background

to group individual elements in order to make the building process easier, maintainable and repetitive.

I tried to group certain elements of the design together and build the piece that way. I am interested in Kevin's professional solution and I am interested to see how different he sees a task.

### Continued development

I want to keep on practicing more html and css and soon adding a little JS to the top
